                <div class="card-body">
                    <p>Traditional GPU mining has a substantial carbon footprint due to its high energy consumption. While GPUs are generally more energy-efficient than ASIC miners, mining operations still require large amounts of electricity, often sourced from fossil fuels.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Energy Consumption:</strong> Mining rigs consume vast amounts of electricity, and if the source of power is non-renewable, it results in increased CO2 emissions.</li>
                        <li><strong>Carbon Emissions:</strong> The environmental impact of mining can be significant, especially in regions where electricity is primarily generated through coal or other fossil fuels.</li>
                        <li><strong>Mitigation:</strong> Some miners are shifting to renewable energy sources (such as solar or wind) to reduce the carbon footprint, but this is not yet universal.</li>
