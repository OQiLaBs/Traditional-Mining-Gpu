                </div>
                <div class="card-body">
                    <p><strong>OQILabs</strong> started its mining operations in 2020, initially focusing on GPU-based mining. Over the years, they expanded their operations, achieving considerable success in the traditional mining sector. However, as the industry evolved, they shifted their focus to maintaining a stable share of 30% in traditional mining while looking ahead to the next evolution of mining technology.</p>
                    <p>Currently, OQILabs focuses on optimizing traditional mining methods, but with a goal to adapt to future trends. This has led them to explore the emerging world of Web3 mining, which they plan to introduce as a key feature in their operations in the near future.</p>

                    <h3>Carbon Footprint of Traditional Mining</h3>
                </div>
                <div class="card-body">
                    <p>Traditional GPU mining has a substantial carbon footprint due to its high energy consumption. While GPUs are generally more energy-efficient than ASIC miners, mining operations still require large amounts of electricity, often sourced from fossil fuels.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Energy Consumption:</strong> Mining rigs consume vast amounts of electricity, and if the source of power is non-renewable, it results in increased CO2 emissions.</li>
                        <li><strong>Carbon Emissions:</strong> The environmental impact of mining can be significant, especially in regions where electricity is primarily generated through coal or other fossil fuels.</li>
                        <li><strong>Mitigation:</strong> Some miners are shifting to renewable energy sources (such as solar or wind) to reduce the carbon footprint, but this is not yet universal.</li>
